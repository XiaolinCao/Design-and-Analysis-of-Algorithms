/*
 * The first line indicates the number of vertices and edges, respectively. Each subsequent 
 * line describes an edge (the first two numbers are its tail and head, respectively) and its length 
 * (the third number). NOTE: some of the edge lengths are negative. NOTE: These graphs may or may 
 * not have negative-cost cycles. Your task is to compute the "shortest shortest path". 
 * Precisely, you must first identify which, if any, of the three graphs have no negative cycles. 
 * For each such graph, you should compute all-pairs shortest paths and remember the smallest one 
 * (i.e., compute \min_{u,v \in V} d(u,v)min u,vâˆˆV d(u,v), where d(u,v)d(u,v) denotes 
 * the shortest-path distance from uu to vv).
 * If each of the three graphs has a negative-cost cycle, then enter "NULL" in the box below. 
 * If exactly one graph has no negative-cost cycles, then enter the length of its shortest shortest 
 * path in the box below. If two or more of the graphs have no negative-cost cycles, then enter the 
 * smallest of the lengths of their shortest shortest paths in the box below.
 * OPTIONAL: You can use whatever algorithm you like to solve this question. If you have extra time, 
 * try comparing the performance of different all-pairs shortest-path algorithms!
 * OPTIONAL: Here is a bigger data set to play with.
